# Cambook

This is my facebook clone built using TDD & node. The backend is going to be a typescript express application with mocha testing and a postgres database. The frontend is not completed but I think I will be using react bundled by esbuild for rapid development.

I want to use docker and heroku as the deployment method as that is how i host my database locally.
